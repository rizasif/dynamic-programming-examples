This project provides three algorithms, all written in separate python files. Please view the attached pdf file to understand the problem in hand. The following algorithms and their test cases are created:

1- Shortest route from top of mountain
2- Best conflict-free conference combination with max profit
3- Natural number combinations which sums up to a given number

To run the code run the following command and comment out unwanted outputs from solution.py
```
python solution.py
``` 

The shortest route algorithem has a complexity of "O(n)".

The best conference algorithem has a complexity of "O(n^2) + O(n)".

The combination algorithm has a complexity of "O(Log(n))".
